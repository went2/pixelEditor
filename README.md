# Description

A pixel editor allows you to edit pixel icon and export.

demo: [pixel-me](https://pixel-me.netlify.app/)

## how to use

1. git clone git@github.com:went2/pixelEditor.git 
2. cd pixelEditor
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

## why wrote this project

The idea and code structure originates from [Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 19](https://eloquentjavascript.net/19_paint.html).

I converted the code into TypeScript and add some features to explore how to draw pixel in HTML canvas and manage states in a vanilla way.

It turns out the way to manage states in JavaScript is quite "Reduxful" in which component dispatches actions, and reducer function caculates the latest state then notifies all components to sync the state. Component decides whether and how to render when receiving latest state.

We need: 

1. A object containing all states of the application
2. A dispatch function passed down to each component. When a component has some interactions with a user, it dispatches actions instead of handle events by itself. Eg.

```ts
class UndoButton implements UIComponent {
  public dom: HTMLButtonElement;
  // 1. UndoButton is initialized with global state and dispatch function
  constructor(state: EditorState, { dispatch }: EditorConfig) {
    this.dom = <HTMLButtonElement>elt(
      "button",
      {
        // 2. It dispatches action instead of handle click event itself when clicked.
        // So the global reducer handles "undo" action and generates a new state
        onclick: () => dispatch({ type: "undo" }),
        disabled: state.done.length == 0,
      },
      "ток Undo"
    );
  }
  // 3. The root App component calls syncState with latest state.
  // Then each component updates its own state
  syncState(state: EditorState) {
    this.dom.disabled = state.done.length == 0;
  }
}
```

3. A reducer function(can be splitted into several) to caculate and return the newest state object based on the current object and action object. The implementation is in `/src/models/reducer.ts`
